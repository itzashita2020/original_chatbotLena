## 🎯 Security Philosophy

### Two Independent Requirements

Every application must satisfy **TWO** independent criteria:

1. ✅ **Functional Requirements** - Application works according to specifications
2. 🔐 **Security Requirements** - Application is protected against threats

**BOTH must be satisfied. One without the other is unacceptable.**

---

## 📋 Security Checklist by Stage

### 🟦 Stage 1: PLANNING

**Before writing any code, identify:**

#### Threat Modeling
- [ ] Who are potential attackers? (Anonymous users, competitors, malicious insiders)
- [ ] What data needs protection? (User data, API keys, business logic)
- [ ] What are attack surfaces? (Public APIs, forms, file uploads, etc)
- [ ] What's the worst-case scenario if compromised?

#### Security Requirements
- [ ] Authentication needed? What type?
- [ ] Authorization/roles required?
- [ ] Sensitive data to encrypt?
- [ ] Compliance requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- [ ] Rate limiting needed?
- [ ] Audit logging required?

#### Data Classification
- [ ] **Public** - Can be freely shared (marketing content)
- [ ] **Internal** - Company use only (internal docs)
- [ ] **Confidential** - Restricted access (user PII)
- [ ] **Secret** - Highest protection (API keys, passwords)

**Deliverable:** Security requirements section in PROJECT_INTAKE.md

---

### 🟦 Stage 2: ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN

**Design security into the system from the start**

#### Secure Architecture Principles
- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege** - Users/services get minimum required permissions
- [ ] **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security (not just one firewall)
- [ ] **Fail Securely** - Errors don't expose sensitive info or bypass security
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns** - Frontend can't access secrets, backend validates everything
- [ ] **Zero Trust** - Never trust input, always validate

#### Architecture Decisions
- [ ] Secrets stored server-side ONLY (never in frontend code)
- [ ] API endpoints require authentication (unless explicitly public)
- [ ] Sensitive operations require additional verification
- [ ] Database access restricted to backend only
- [ ] Third-party services vetted for security

#### Data Flow Security
```
User Input → Validation → Sanitization → Processing → Output Encoding
                ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓
           (Reject bad)   (Clean data)  (Business)  (Prevent XSS)
```

**Deliverable:** Security architecture section in ARCHITECTURE.md

### 🟦 Stage 3: DEVELOPMENT

**Write secure code from the first line**

#### 🔴 NEVER DO (Critical Security Violations)

1. **❌ NEVER hardcode secrets in code**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ WRONG
   const apiKey = "sk-proj-abc123..."

   // ✅ CORRECT
   const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY
   ```

2. **❌ NEVER trust user input**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ WRONG - SQL Injection vulnerability
   db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`)

   // ✅ CORRECT - Parameterized query
   db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])
   ```

3. **❌ NEVER expose sensitive data in errors**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ WRONG
   res.status(500).json({ error: error.stack, dbPassword: process.env.DB_PASS })

   // ✅ CORRECT
   console.error(error) // Log internally
   res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' })
   ```

4. **❌ NEVER use `eval()` or similar with user input**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ WRONG - Code injection
   eval(userInput)
   new Function(userInput)()

   // ✅ CORRECT - Use safe alternatives
   JSON.parse(userInput) // If expecting JSON
   ```

5. **❌ NEVER disable security features**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ WRONG
   app.use(cors({ origin: '*' })) // Allows any origin

   // ✅ CORRECT
   app.use(cors({ origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL }))
   ```

#### ✅ ALWAYS DO (Essential Security Practices)

1. **✅ ALWAYS validate input**
   ```typescript
   // Validate type, format, length, range
   function sanitizeEmail(email: string): string {
     if (typeof email !== 'string') throw new Error('Invalid type')
     if (email.length > 255) throw new Error('Too long')
     if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email)) throw new Error('Invalid format')
     return email.toLowerCase().trim()
   }
   ```

2. **✅ ALWAYS use environment variables for secrets**
   ```bash
   # .env.local (NEVER commit this file)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   JWT_SECRET=random-long-string
   ```

3. **✅ ALWAYS sanitize output (prevent XSS)**
   ```javascript
   // React does this automatically for JSX
   <div>{userContent}</div> // ✅ Safe

   // Be careful with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userContent}} /> // ❌ Dangerous

   // If you must use HTML, sanitize first
   import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: DOMPurify.sanitize(userContent)}} />
   ```

4. **✅ ALWAYS use HTTPS in production**
   ```javascript
   // Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && req.protocol === 'http') {
     return res.redirect(301, `https://${req.hostname}${req.url}`)
   }
   ```

5. **✅ ALWAYS implement rate limiting**
   ```javascript
   import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   })

   app.use('/api/', limiter)
   ```

#### Common Vulnerabilities to Prevent

| Vulnerability | Prevention |
|---------------|-----------|
| **SQL Injection** | Use parameterized queries, ORMs |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Sanitize output, use React/Vue (auto-escaping) |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | Use CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies |
| **Authentication bypass** | Never trust client-side auth, validate server-side |
| **Broken Access Control** | Check permissions on EVERY request |
| **Sensitive Data Exposure** | Encrypt at rest, in transit, never log secrets |
| **Security Misconfiguration** | Review default configs, disable debug in prod |
| **Insecure Dependencies** | Regular `npm audit`, update packages |

#### Secure Coding Checklist

**For Every Feature:**
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output sanitization applied
- [ ] Authentication checked (if required)
- [ ] Authorization verified (user has permission)
- [ ] Errors handled securely (no sensitive data leaked)
- [ ] Secrets in environment variables (not code)
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (if using SQL)
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting applied (for APIs)

**Deliverable:** Secure code following AGENTS.md security rules

### 🟦 Stage 4: TESTING

**Test security, not just functionality**

#### Security Testing Checklist

##### 4.1 Dependency Audit
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Auto-fix if possible
npm audit fix

# Review high/critical vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

##### 4.2 Secret Scanning
- [ ] No API keys in code (search for common patterns)
- [ ] No passwords in code
- [ ] No tokens in git history
- [ ] `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Secrets in `.env.example` are placeholders only

**Tools:**
```bash
# Manual check
grep -r "sk-proj" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "AIza" . --exclude-dir=node_modules

# Or use automated tools
npm install -g secretlint
secretlint "**/*"
```

##### 4.3 Authentication & Authorization Testing
- [ ] Try accessing protected routes without auth
- [ ] Try accessing other users' data
- [ ] Try privilege escalation (user → admin)
- [ ] Test password reset flow
- [ ] Test session expiration

##### 4.4 Input Validation Testing
- [ ] Send empty values
- [ ] Send extremely long strings (1M+ characters)
- [ ] Send special characters: `<script>`, `'; DROP TABLE--`, `../../../etc/passwd`
- [ ] Send wrong data types (string instead of number)
- [ ] Send negative numbers where positive expected
- [ ] Send future dates where past expected

##### 4.5 API Security Testing
- [ ] Test without authentication token
- [ ] Test with expired token
- [ ] Test with manipulated token
- [ ] Test rate limiting (send 1000 requests rapidly)
- [ ] Test CORS (request from unauthorized origin)

##### 4.6 Frontend Security Testing
- [ ] Open DevTools → Check for secrets in source code
- [ ] Check Network tab → Ensure no secrets in requests
- [ ] Check Local Storage → No sensitive data stored
- [ ] Check Cookies → HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite set correctly
- [ ] Test XSS: Input `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`

##### 4.7 Environment Variables Testing
- [ ] App fails gracefully if required env vars missing
- [ ] Env vars never logged to console
- [ ] Different env vars for dev/staging/production
- [ ] Production env vars never committed to git

**Deliverable:** Security test results documented, all issues fixed

# Static code analysis
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx

# License compliance
npx license-checker
```

### Manual Testing Tools
- **Browser DevTools** - Check network, storage, console
- **Postman/Insomnia** - API security testing
- **OWASP ZAP** - Web application security scanner
- **Burp Suite** - Advanced penetration testing

---

## 🚨 Common Security Anti-Patterns

### ❌ "Security Theatre" (Looks secure, isn't)
```javascript
// Client-side only validation - attacker can bypass
if (password.length < 8) return "Too short"

// ✅ MUST validate on server too
```

### ❌ "Security by Obscurity"
```javascript
// Hiding API endpoint doesn't make it secure
// /api/secret-admin-endpoint-xyz123 ← still vulnerable

// ✅ Use proper authentication
```

### ❌ "Trust the Frontend"
```javascript
// ❌ Frontend says user is admin, backend believes it
const isAdmin = req.body.isAdmin // Attacker can set this!

// ✅ Backend checks user role from authenticated session
const isAdmin = await checkUserRole(req.userId)
```

## 🎯 Security Culture

### For Developers
- **Think like an attacker** - "How would I break this?"
- **Security is everyone's job** - Not just security team
- **When in doubt, ask** - Better to ask than create vulnerability
- **Document security decisions** - Why we chose approach X over Y

### For AI Agents
- **Read SECURITY.md before coding** - Security rules are not optional
- **Flag security concerns immediately** - Don't proceed if unsure
- **Never optimize by removing security** - Performance < Security
- **Document security assumptions** - What threats are we protecting against?
